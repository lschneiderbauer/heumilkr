#' Clark-Wright algorithm (Capacitated Vehicle Routing
#' Problem solver)
#'
#' Finds a quasi-optimal solution to the Capacitated Vehicle Routing
#' Problem (CVRP). It is assumed that all demands will be satisfied by a
#' single source.
#'
#' @details
#' See the original paper,
#' [Clarke, G. and Wright, J.R. (1964)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.12.4.568),
#' for a detailed explanation of the Clarke-Wright algorithm.
#'
#' @param demand
#'  A numeric vector consisting of "demands" indexed by sites.
#'  The `i`th entry refers to the demand of site `i` (and the length
#'  of the vector equals the number of sites `N` with demands). The
#'  units of the demand values need to match the units of the
#'  vehicle capacity values. `NA` values are not allowed.
#'
#' @param distances
#'  An object of class `dist`, created by [stats::dist()], with
#'  `(N + 1)` locations describing the distances between individual
#'  sites. The first index refers to the source site. The `(i+1)`'th
#'  index refers to site `i` (as defined by `demand`).
#'
#' @param vehicles
#'  A [data.frame()] describing available vehicle types and their respective
#'  capacities. One row per vehicle type. The data frame is expected to have
#'  two columns:
#'  * `n` - Number of available vehicles. This can be set to `NA` if the
#'          number is "infinite" (i.e. effectively the maximal integer value
#'          on your machine.).
#'          It is recommended to keep at least one vehicle type as "infinite",
#'          otherwise the solver might raise a run time error due to initially
#'          not having enough vehicles available (even though the final
#'          solution might satisfy the availability restrictions).
#'  * `caps` - The vehicle capacity in same units as `demand`.
#'
#'  The order of the [data.frame()] is relevant and determines the prioritization
#'  of vehicle assignments to runs (in case two or more vehicle types are
#'  eligible for assignment the "first" vehicle is chosen). In a typical scenario
#'  "more expensive" vehicles should be further down in the list (so the cheaper
#'  one is chosen in case there is doubt). Since higher capacity vehicles
#'  usually involve higher costs sorting the data frame by capacity is usually
#'  a good rule of thumb.
#'
#' @param restrictions
#'  An optional [data.frame()] that allows to define vehicle type restrictions for
#'  particular sites in the form of a blacklist.
#'  The data frame is expected to have two columns:
#'  * `vehicle` - The vehicle type index.
#'  * `site` - The site index (i.e. the index of the `demand` vector)
#'
#'  Each row defines a restriction: <vehicle type> can not approach <site>.
#'  Defaults to `NULL`, i.e. no restrictions are enforced.
#'
#' @return
#'  Returns a "`heumilkr_result`" object, a [data.frame()] with one row per
#'  site-run combination bestowed with additional attributes.
#'  * `site` - The site index (i.e. the index of the `demand` vector) associated
#'             to the run.
#'  * `run` - Identifies the run the site is assigned to.
#'  * `order`  - Integer values providing the visiting order within each run.
#'  * `vehicle` - The vehicle type index (as provided in `vehicles`) associated
#'                to the run.
#'  * `load` - The actual load in units of `demand` on the particular run.
#'  * `distance` - The traveled distance of the particular run.
#'
#'  Unless a site demand exceeds the vehicle capacities it is always assigned
#'  to only a single run.
