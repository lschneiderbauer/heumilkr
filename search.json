One row per vehicle type. data frame expected two columns: n - Number available vehicles. can set NA number \"infinite\" (.e. effectively maximal integer value machine.). recommended keep least one vehicle type \"infinite\", otherwise solver might raise run time error due initially enough vehicles available (even though final solution might satisfy availability restrictions). caps - vehicle capacity units demand. order data.frame() relevant determines prioritization vehicle assignments runs (case two vehicle types eligible assignment \"first\" vehicle chosen). typical scenario \"expensive\" vehicles list (cheaper one chosen case doubt). Since higher capacity vehicles usually involve higher costs sorting data frame capacity usually good rule thumb. restrictions optional data.frame() allows define vehicle type restrictions particular sites form blacklist. data frame expected two columns: vehicle - vehicle type index. site - site index (.e. index demand vector) row defines restriction: vehicle type vehicle can approach site site.
