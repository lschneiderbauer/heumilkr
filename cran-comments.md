-   Addressing R CMD check note:\
    The note warns about a potential spelling mistake of the word "Capacitated". While it is an unusual word it is widely used in the literature to refer to the particular problem this package addresses ("Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem"). I do wish to preserve that phrase to be consistent with the naming in literature.
