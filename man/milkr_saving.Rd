\title{Vehicle run saving}
\usage{
milkr_saving(res, relative = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{res}{A "\code{heumilkr_result}" object, typically obtained by \code{\link[=clarke_wright]{clarke_wright()}}.}

\item{relative}{Should the saving be given as dimensionful value (in units of distance as
provided to \code{\link[=clarke_wright]{clarke_wright()}}), or as percentage relative to the
naive costs.
Defaults to \code{FALSE}, i.e. a dimensionful value.}
}
\value{
The savings either as dimensionful value or as percentage relative to the
naive costs, depending on \code{relative}.
}
\description{
Measures the saving that was achieved by the heuristic optimization
algorithm \code{\link[=clarke_wright]{clarke_wright()}} compared to the naive vehicle run assignment,
i.e. one run per site.
